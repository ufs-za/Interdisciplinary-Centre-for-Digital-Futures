# 📱 Social Media and Social Listening

This folder is part of the ICDF’s broader digital humanities initiative to understand and respond to public discourse using computational tools. The **Social Media and Social Listening** stream focuses on real-time insights, misinformation mapping, and infodemiology — the study of the spread and impact of information, particularly during crises.

Developed in close collaboration with the [Knowledge Mapping Labs](https://www.knowledgemappinglabs.com/), this work bridges public health, digital politics, behavioural analytics, and social signal processing.

---

## 🎯 Focus and Objectives

We aim to develop tools and research frameworks that:
- **Monitor and analyse public discourse** in real time
- **Track the spread of misinformation** and its effects on behaviours
- **Model social stress, anxiety, and disease spread** from high-frequency online data
- **Support early warning systems** for crisis communication and social intervention

We use data from social media platforms (e.g., Twitter/X, YouTube, Reddit), news APIs, and Google Trends — all ethically collected and responsibly governed.

## 🧠 Featured Projects

### 🧪 1. **Social Stress Indicator (SSI)**

A composite score generated from:

* Sentiment analysis
* Information-seeking behaviour (via Google Trends)
* Topic engine volatility and network centrality

Used to model **collective anxiety**, **uncertainty**, and **disease emergence** signals from public discourse.

### ⚠️ 2. **Misinformation Detection and Mapping**

* Network-based detection of misinformation hubs
* Topic drift and agenda shifting in online discourse
* Reinforcement learning simulations of misinformation spread
* Edge-based LDA models to detect coordinated narratives

### 📊 3. **Digital Epidemiology Dashboards**

* Integration with COVID-19 and disease reporting datasets
* Crisis informatics visualised over time and geography
* Streamlit-powered decision support apps
* Collaboration with public health and communication teams

### 📡 4. **Social Listening Reports**

* Monthly and event-based PDF reports on social discourse trends
* Use of human-in-the-loop verification and framing analysis
* Analysis of civic unrest, protest narratives, and vaccine discourse

All reports and tools are curated by the [Knowledge Mapping Labs](https://www.knowledgemappinglabs.com/).

---

## 🧪 Sample Use Cases

* **Health Policy**: Use real-time dashboards to inform public messaging
* **Disinformation Defence**: Identify actors and networks spreading false narratives
* **Digital Mental Health**: Quantify online expressions of stress, burnout, or anxiety
* **Political Crisis Monitoring**: Track public sentiment and narrative shifts during elections or conflict
