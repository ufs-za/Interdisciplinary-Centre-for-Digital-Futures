# 🏛️ Digital Heritage

Welcome to the **Digital Heritage** research stream of the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Digital Futures (ICDF)](https://www.ufs.ac.za/icdf/icdf-home/digital-heritage) at the [University of the Free State (UFS)](https://www.ufs.ac.za/). This space is dedicated to reimagining heritage through **eco-decolonial museology**, **shared epistemologies**, and **undisciplinary research** that centres not only outcomes, but process, participation, and cultural context.

> “Culture is like the hub which is nearest to the axle of a wheel... it can only turn when it is maintained.” — *Jürgen Witt*

Heritage is not a static archive of the past. It is dynamic, evolving, and always situated in tension — between remembrance and forgetting, between voice and silence, between communities and institutions. In this stream, we explore heritage as an ongoing **work-in-process** through digital tools, co-production, and ethical storytelling.

## 🎯 Vision

- Promote **inclusive, community-partnered heritage research**
- Document heritage as **a layered, living archive**, shaped by interpretation, storytelling, and spatial memory
- Use **digital tools** to visualise, map, and extend access to heritage collections and sites
- Engage in **bottom-up knowledge making** through “shared epistemologies” and transdisciplinary inquiry

We draw on methodologies inspired by:
- 📖 *Pahl & Pool’s* “shared epistemologies”
- 🌀 *Johnson & Marwood’s* “undisciplinary” knowledge production
- 🌍 *Jeffery’s* “eco-decolonial museology”

## 🧭 Core Projects

### 1. 🛤️ The Forgotten Highway: Ancestral Journeys

This project, in collaboration with the [Karoo Development Foundation](https://www.karoodevelopmentfoundation.org/), documents a 1 000 km stretch of the **northern Karoo and southern Kalahari**, traversing the early **intercultural frontier zones** of South Africa. The route includes:

* Tulbagh to Kuruman
* !Xam, Khoi, Korana, Griqua, Tswana, Xhosa, and trekboer routes
* Stories of **slaves, ex-slaves, explorers, and Indigenous knowledge holders**
* Mapping of **collaborative and conflictual interactions**
* A digital approach to understanding the **emergence of hybrid South African identities**

🧭 This project is supported by:

* National Heritage Council
* National Lotteries Commission
* Millenium Trust
* Finnish Embassy
* Dutch Culture NGO

📍 We aim to digitally map routes, stories, artefacts, and landscapes into one coherent **ancestral journeying interface**.

### 2. 🗿 The Limpopo Heritage Collection

In collaboration with **ZZ2**, an agricultural enterprise and custodian of the **Jürgen Witt Art and Artefact Trust**, this project curates and digitises a unique heritage collection from **Tsonga, Venda, Pedi, and Sotho** communities in Limpopo.

Key elements:

* Artefacts from the Modjadji people, including traditions of the Rain Queen
* Contemporary Modjadji pieces under collection curation
* A cache of **handwritten Tsonga folktales**, recorded in the early 2000s by the daughters of artist Philip Rikhotso
* Focus on **Indigenous storytelling** and intergenerational transmission

🌱 This project champions a **participatory, co-curated digitisation process** with the goal of respectful access, historical justice, and deep cultural continuity.

## 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 Community-Centred Heritage Practice

Our digital heritage approach:

* Values *co-production* with local, academic, and non-traditional stakeholders
* Avoids extractive or top-down interpretations
* Links **artefacts to place, memory, and story**
* Prioritises **accessibility and relevance**, not just academic visibility

We emphasise:

* **Process over outcome**
* **Care over control**
* **Context over curation**
