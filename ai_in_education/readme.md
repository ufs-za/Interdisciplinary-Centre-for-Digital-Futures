# 🧠 AI in Education (AIED)

This directory hosts the **AI in Education (AIED)** stream of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Digital Futures (ICDF) at the [University of the Free State (UFS)](https://www.ufs.ac.za/icdf). It showcases tools, guides, data, and experiments focused on integrating **Artificial Intelligence into education**, pedagogy, curriculum design, and institutional transformation.

This stream is developed in partnership with the [Digital Scholarship Centre (DSC)](https://www.ufs.ac.za/dsc/digital-scholarship-centre-home), drawing together research, workshops, digital stories, and responsible AI practice at the university.
