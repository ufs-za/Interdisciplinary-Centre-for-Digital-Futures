# 🗣️ Human Language Technology (HLT)

Welcome to the **Human Language Technology** focus area of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Digital Futures (ICDF), housed within the [University of the Free State (UFS)](https://www.ufs.ac.za/icdf). This folder supports the research, development, deployment, and documentation of inclusive, ethical, and interdisciplinary language technologies — with a strong focus on under-resourced languages and signed languages such as **South African Sign Language (SASL)**.

---

## 🎯 Focus and Objectives

Our HLT research addresses the digital divide in language resources and aims to:
- Create inclusive and ethical language datasets
- Develop open-access tools for linguistic annotation and translation
- Advance sign language technologies including glossing, generation, and avatar synthesis
- Promote responsible AI for linguistically and culturally diverse communities

We explicitly foreground **Ubuntu ethics**, AI fairness, and Deaf-led research practices in all our HLT work.

## 🔗 Primary HLT Repository

For active projects, models, and SASL data pipelines, please visit our standalone GitHub repository:

🔗 [**South African Sign Language HLT GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/your-org/sasl-hlt)

This includes:
- Glossing engines and dictionaries
- CNN, LSTM, and RL-based sign recognition models
- Streamlit apps for annotation and translation
- Ethical licensing and data governance documents
