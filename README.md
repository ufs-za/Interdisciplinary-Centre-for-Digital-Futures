Welcome to the ICDF where our ethos is rooted in scholarly research with societal impact. The University of the Free State (UFS) is a research-led institution focused on impactful and engaged scholarship. Through the ICDF, the UFS seeks to create opportunities for research in the fast-evolving and multifaceted realm of the digital. Our focus is to develop and to strengthen research endevours with the potential to enhance interdisciplinary competencies within the socio-digital domain. This vision will lead to projects that are creative and conducive to dialogues of co-creation and co-development among diverse partners to unlock a wide array of contributions that should ultimately address our immediate societal challenges. We endeavour to create lasting relationships with non-academic partners as well as to forge dynamic and mutually beneficial networks between Global South and Global North colleagues. 

At the ICDF, we strive towards the following: 
-	to engage with interdisciplinary endeavours, as this would encapsulate our existing strength and our most fundamental value – that of collaboration and co-creation. The ICDF seeks to think beyond using siloed discipline-specific solutions, and focuses on the cross-pollination of skills, perspectives, and human capital in a digital era to culminate into more sustainable solutions.
-	to create and to sustain long-term third-stream income activities in collaboration with other institutions of higher learning, industry, and the public sector. This will be attained through the development of shared intellectual property endeavours, commercialisation, short-learning programmes, and curriculum development at graduate and post-graduate level. 
-	to enhance the UFS’s academic footprint by producing quality research outputs that are academic as well as entrepreneurial in nature. 
-	to be socially relevant and impactful through research, innovation, and entrepreneurship to lead to job creation, poverty alleviation, gender empowerment, and the creation of novel additions to existing university curricula.
-	to forge strong linkages between a wide array of partners, such as Global South and Global North allies to cooperate on joint proposal calls and projects, to create shared degrees and to co-supervise students, to develop shared intellectual property, as well as to leverage from skills that will benefit both contexts in meaningful ways.
