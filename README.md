**Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Digital Futures (ICDF)** at the [University of the Free State (UFS)](https://www.ufs.ac.za/icdf). This repository serves as a collaborative and interdisciplinary knowledge hub for researchers, educators, students, and partner institutions working on critical topics in the digital humanities.

We support **research, code development, data sharing, and community engagement** across four core areas:
- 🌐 Human Language Technology (HLT)
- 🧠 AI in Education (AIED)
- 📱 Social Media & Social Listening
- 🏛️ Digital Heritage

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is designed to:
- Serve as a research and development platform for ICDF’s digital projects
- Provide public access to curated datasets, source code, and technical documentation
- Showcase collaborative research outputs from ICDF’s thematic areas
- Encourage interdisciplinary dialogue between academia, technology, and society

Interested collaborators are invited to reach out via our [Contact Page](https://www.ufs.ac.za/icdf/icdf-home/contact-us).

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each **focus area** is represented by its own top-level directory:


📁 human_language_technology/
📁 digital_heritage/
📁 social_media_listening/
📁 aied/

-	to forge strong linkages between a wide array of partners, such as Global South and Global North allies to cooperate on joint proposal calls and projects, to create shared degrees and to co-supervise students, to develop shared intellectual property, as well as to leverage from skills that will benefit both contexts in meaningful ways.
